# Relation Matrix Properties Counter
Relations play a very fundamental role in Discrete Mathematics and can be used for various purposes in computer science
(check [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) out).<br><br> Relations between a set of _n_ elements can be represented by a _n_ by _n_ **relation matrix** full of 1s and 0s,
describing wether elements are related or not according to the defined criteria.<br><br>
This repository consists of a Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of functions that analyze a relation matrix and check for symmetry, reflexiveness and transitivity,
as well as a discussion about relations and definitions for basic properties.
